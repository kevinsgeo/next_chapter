## Introduction
Books are expensive, and many avid readers end up with piles of books they no longer need but hesitate to sell. Recognizing the urgent need for more sustainable reading practices, NextChapter provides an eco-friendly alternative that maximizes the lifecycle of books by providing a dedicated platform that brings book lovers together, especially on a local level.

### Why is this important?
A report by [Book Riot](https://bookriot.com/book-price-increase/) indicates that the average cost of books has increased by 11-30%, limiting access to reading materials. Additionally, the production of new books significantly impacts the environment, contributing to deforestation and increased carbon emissions. NextChapter promotes a sustainable model of book consumption by extending the lifecycle of books through swapping.

### What is Our App?
NextChapter is a mobile-first Android app that allows users to swap books based on their preferences and location. Users can upload pictures of books they wish to swap, browse books offered by others, and arrange swaps with people nearby using geolocation. Users can also maintain a wishlist of books and receive notifications when a book from their list is uploaded nearby. If a swap is not found, users can choose to donate the books to local charity organizations.

#### Additional features include:
- **User Reviews:** Users can review each other after swaps, and verified, trusted users will earn a “verified” status. Users can also review individual books.
- **Sustainability Tracker:** Shows users how much they’ve contributed to reducing their carbon footprint by swapping books rather than buying new ones.
- **AI Recommendations:** The app uses AI to suggest books based on users' swapping history and wishlists.

### Why should users care?
NextChapter offers an eco-friendly, budget-conscious solution for readers who want to access new books without buying them. It builds a community of trusted swappers and emphasizes sustainability while providing a personalized book recommendation experience.

#### Target Audience:
- Students looking to swap textbooks
- Avid readers wanting to trade fiction/non-fiction books
- Eco-conscious users who care about sustainability
- Local communities looking for a way to share resources

We will interact with these users to gather feedback throughout the development process, ensuring the app is user-friendly and meets their needs.

### Our competition:
The main competitor is Swappy Books, which allows users to swap books in a similar fashion.

#### Experience with Swappy Books:
While Swappy Books offers a basic swapping mechanism, it lacks key features that make the process more secure, efficient, and community-focused. The review system on Swappy Books is basic, and the app doesn’t offer a wishlist system or AI-driven recommendations.

#### What makes NextChapter better?
- **AI Recommendations:** Provides personalized suggestions for users based on past interactions and wishlists.
- **Sustainability Tracker:** Unique feature promoting environmental awareness by showing users how much they’ve saved in carbon emissions.
- **Verified Swapper System:** Adds trust and security to the swapping process, encouraging users to engage more frequently.
- **Frequent Updates:** Offers frequent, high-quality updates, ensuring a modern and responsive UI, unlike Swappy Books which hasn’t been updated in six years.

## Main Modules of Our App:
### 1. Mobile Device Side
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload pictures of books using the device camera.
- **Geolocation:** Enables users to swap locally by showing available books nearby.
- **Notifications:** Real-time notifications for wishlist book availability.
- **Touchscreen Interface:** Smooth user interaction with swiping functionality to browse books.

### 2. Server-Side
- **User and Book Database:** Stores user profiles, book listings, reviews, and swapping history.
- **AI Recommendation Engine:** Analyzes user activity and wishlist to suggest books.
- **Sustainability Tracker:** Calculates and displays carbon footprint savings for users.

### 3. Third Party Services
- **Geolocation API:** Google Maps API or similar for location-based matching.
- **AI Model:** Uses a machine learning framework like TensorFlow Lite for recommendations.

## Mobile Innovation:
- **Geolocation-based Matching:** Matches users based on proximity, making it easier to swap books locally.
- **AI-Powered Book Recommendations:** Suggests books users are likely to want based on their wishlist and previous swaps.
- **Touch-Based User Experience:** Uses swipe gestures for navigation and book browsing, designed specifically for mobile interaction.
- **Camera Integration for Book Listings:** Utilizes the mobile device’s camera to quickly capture and upload images of books, enhancing the mobile experience.

## Testing Our App:

We will need access to Android phones for testing the various features, especially geolocation, notifications, and camera functionality. We have access to at least 1 Android device among our team members.

### Testing Environments:
We’ll test across different Android versions to ensure compatibility and smooth performance.

### User Testing:
We plan to involve potential users early in the process to get feedback on usability and features.
